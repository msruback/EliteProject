# EliteProject
A small app that grabs https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet and presents news articles. The app has several styles that can be changed on the fly in an options menu. Focus was on making a unified style.
Plans are to use the eddb.io JSON api to get trade data, from which users should be able to search for commodities, stations, ships, and ship parts under the TRADE tab. Under the SHIP tab, users should be able to create and save a ship, add parts, and get various ship stats. Will need to look into how these stats are calculated.
